          Yesterday, All those backups seemed a waste of pay.<br />
          Now my database has gone away.<br />
          Oh I believe in yesterday.

          Suddenly, There's not half the files there used to be,<br />
          And there's a milestone hanging over me.<br />
          The system crashed so suddenly.<br />
          I pushed something wrong, What it was I could not say.

          Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

        <p class="orange-red-container">
          Yesterday, The need for back-ups seemed so far away.<br />
          I knew my data was all here to stay,<br />
          Now I believe in yesterday.
