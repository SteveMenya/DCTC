        Yesterday, All those backups seemed a waste of pay. Now my database has
        gone away. Oh I believe in yesterday.
      </div>
      <div>
        Suddenly, There's not half the files there used to be, And there's a
        milestone hanging over me. The system crashed so suddenly. I pushed
        something wrong, What it was I could not say.
      </div>
      <div
        style="
          background-color: orange;

        Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

        Yesterday, The need for back-ups seemed so far away. I knew my data was
        all here to stay, Now I believe in yesterday.
